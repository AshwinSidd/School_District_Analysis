# School_District_Analysis

**Overview**
The school board wanted to check for academic dishonesty for the 9th grades of Thomas High School, specificaly in math and reading. The purpose was to replace the scores of both these subjects as NaNs while keeping the rest the same. Then the analysis had to be run to see if any changes appeared and if it indeed affected the overall analysis. 

**Results of the analysis**
1. *District Summary* - The district summary shows not much of a change. The overall passing % was at 64.9 with %passing in math was 74.8 and in reading as 85.7 for Thomas High.

**Summary**
Though for a large data size like this, replacing a few elements had minimal ignificant affects on the analysis. A few changes that one could observe were the changes in the count students at Thomas High and the overall count of students as the data for THS was replaced by NaN. This also lead to the decrease in the overall population, having changes in the overall averages and percentages of the analysis.
